Stattic is a flexible static site generator that lets you customize the way your site is built through a variety of command-line arguments. These arguments allow you to minify files, choose fonts, change the number of posts per page, and more.

In this post, we'll go through some of the most useful command-line arguments you can use with Stattic to tailor the build process to your needs.

## Basic Usage

To start with, let's look at the basic command to build your site with Stattic:

```
python3 stattic.py --output=output
```

This command will build your site and save the generated files into the output folder.

But there's so much more you can do! Let's dive into the different arguments you can use.

## Using the `--minify` Flag

One of the most useful features of <a href="/">Stattic</a> is the ability to minify all of your CSS and JavaScript files with the `--minify` flag. This is great for production environments where you want to reduce the file size of your assets for faster page load times.

### Example Usage:

```
python3 stattic.py --output=output --minify
```

This will:

* Combine all CSS files into a single `main.min.css` file.
* Combine all JavaScript files into a single `main.min.js` file.
* Ensure that your base.html template includes these minified files.

### What Happens Under the Hood?

When the `--minify` flag is used, Stattic will concatenate and minify all CSS and JS files in the assets folder, creating a `main.min.css` and `main.min.js` in the `output/assets` folder. These minified files are automatically referenced in the HTML files instead of the uncompressed versions.

## Adding Google Fonts with `--fonts`

Want to include Google Fonts in your site? **Stattic** lets you specify which fonts to download using the `--fonts` argument. By default, the Quicksand font is used but you are able to override it with your own fonts.

### Example Usage:

```
python3 stattic.py --output=output --fonts="Roboto,Open+Sans"
```

This command will download the specified fonts (in this case, Roboto and Open Sans) and automatically generate CSS files to use them in your site.

### How It Works:

* Stattic fetches the fonts from the Google Fonts API.
* It saves the fonts locally in the `output/assets/fonts/` directory.
* A CSS file (`fonts.css`) is generated that includes `@font-face` rules for each specified font and their various weights.

You can then apply these fonts using the generated classes (e.g., `.roboto-400, .open-sans-300`).

## Applying Custom Fonts in HTML

Once you've added your fonts using the `--fonts` argument, you can easily apply them in your HTML templates by using the class names generated by Stattic.

For example, to apply Roboto 400 to a heading:

```
`<h1 class="roboto-400">Welcome to My Site</h1>`
```

## Customizing the Number of Posts per Page with `--posts-per-page`

By default, Stattic shows 5 posts per page, but you can change this using the `--posts-per-page` argument.

### Example Usage:

```
python3 stattic.py --output=output --posts-per-page=10
```

This will generate pages that show `10` posts at a time, instead of the default `5`.

## How It Works:

Stattic will paginate your posts, creating multiple pages (if necessary) based on the number of posts you choose to display. This is particularly useful if you have a blog with a lot of content and want to limit the number of posts on the homepage or archive pages.

## Sorting Posts by Date, Title, or Author with `--sort-by`

You can also change the way posts are sorted using the `--sort-by` argument. You can sort posts by date, title, or author.

### Example Usage:

```
python3 stattic.py --output=output --sort-by=title
```

This will sort the posts alphabetically by their title when building the site.

### Available Options:

* `--sort-by=date` (default)
* `--sort-by=title`
* `--sort-by=author`

## Watching for File Changes with `--watch`

If you're actively developing a site and making frequent changes, the `--watch` flag is a huge time-saver. It automatically rebuilds the site whenever you change a content file.

### Example Usage:

```
python3 stattic.py --output=output --watch
```

With this command, Stattic will continue running in the background, watching for changes to your Markdown, template, or asset files. Whenever it detects a change, it will rebuild the site automatically, so you don't need to run the build command manually each time.

## Combining Multiple Arguments

You can combine multiple arguments to customize your build even further. For example, you can download fonts, set the number of posts per page, and enable minification all at once:

### Example Usage:

```
python3 stattic.py --output=output --minify --fonts="Lato,Montserrat" --posts-per-page=8 --sort-by=date
```

This will:

* Minify all CSS and JS files.
* Download the Lato and Montserrat fonts.
* Display 8 posts per page.
* Sort posts by date.
