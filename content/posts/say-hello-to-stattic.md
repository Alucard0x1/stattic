Welcome to **Stattic**, the lightweight, no-fuss, modern static site generator that's changing the way websites are built. If you've ever been frustrated with the complexity, sluggishness, and endless database queries of traditional content management systems (yes, we're looking at you, **WordPress**), then Stattic is here to offer a better way forward.

## What is Stattic?

Stattic is a **static site generator** designed for developers, content creators, and anyone who values **speed**, **simplicity**, and **security** in their website builds. Stattic takes your content, processes it with modern templating, and outputs pure **static HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** files that can be deployed anywhere – from simple web hosts to CDNs like Netlify or GitHub Pages.

### Why Stattic?

In today's fast-paced web, users demand **speed** and **reliability**. While WordPress sites often fall victim to slow database calls, bloated plugins, and constant security patches, Stattic keeps things lean and mean.

Here's what you can expect when you build with Stattic:

### 1. **Blazing Fast Page Loads**

With Stattic, you can forget about slow load times. Stattic sites are **static HTML** at their core, meaning no server-side rendering or database calls are needed. Every page is pre-rendered and ready to be served instantly, resulting in blazing fast page loads. Say goodbye to that dreaded **"waiting for the database"** delay that can leave your visitors hanging on WordPress.

### 2. **No Database, No Problem**

Databases are great until they aren't. When they go down, get corrupted, or become a security vulnerability, your entire site can go with them. Stattic doesn't need a database at all. That's right, your site is pure **static files** – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This means less to go wrong and more reliability, especially under high traffic.

### 3. **Modern, Clean Code**

Stattic leverages modern web development practices like templating with **Jinja2**, a Python-powered templating engine. Your templates stay clean, reusable, and easy to maintain. You can apply DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles to your layout, making design changes effortless across your site. Unlike WordPress, where themes can feel like tangled spaghetti code, Stattic keeps things modular and organized.

### 4. **Security as a Standard**

By removing the need for dynamic server-side rendering and databases, you eliminate a huge number of potential attack vectors. Stattic websites are inherently more secure because there are no moving parts that can be exploited by hackers. No more worrying about outdated plugins or surprise security vulnerabilities that can make your WordPress site a target.

### 5. **Flexibility with Zero Bloat**

If you've ever worked with WordPress, you know how quickly things can get bloated with unused plugins, themes, and database tables. Stattic is different. It's lightweight and only includes what you need. If you want to integrate a new feature, you simply add it to the codebase – no plugins required, no bloat added.

### 6. **Fully Customizable**

Stattic gives you full control over every aspect of your website. Need custom fonts? With Stattic's `--fonts` option, you can download and include any Google Fonts you like. Want a clean and efficient build process? Use the `--minify` flag to compress all your CSS and JavaScript into optimized single files, reducing load times and improving performance.

Here's a quick example of how easy it is to build your site with Stattic:

```
python3 stattic.py --output=output --minify --fonts="Lato,Montserrat"
```

In one simple command, Stattic:

* Builds your site into the output folder.
* Minifies your CSS and JS files for faster load times.
* Downloads and includes the Lato and Montserrat fonts for use in your design.

### 7. Hosting Freedom

Since Stattic outputs static files, you're not tied down to any specific hosting provider. You can deploy your Stattic site anywhere – GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or even on traditional servers. No need to pay for heavy managed hosting like some other platforms force you into (cough WordPress cough).

### 8. No More Updates Breaking Your Site

How many times has a WordPress update caused something to break on your site? It's a never-ending cycle of patching, fixing, and hoping nothing crashes. Stattic is simple: once your site is built, there's no moving parts to update or break. It just works.

### Why Move Away from WordPress?

While WordPress has had its time and place, its complexity has grown over the years. With each update comes the risk of breaking plugins, themes, or customizations. Security vulnerabilities are a constant concern, and managing performance with a database-backed site can be challenging.

**Stattic** is the alternative for developers and site owners who want control, speed, and security without the headache of managing servers, databases, and plugins. It's built for the future of the web: static, fast, and reliable.

Whether you're a developer looking for a clean and customizable solution or a small business owner who just wants a fast and secure website, Stattic will get you there with less hassle.
